Shell Commands

<shell id="shellId" exec_dir="/absolute/path/to/dir">
Command(s) to execute. Use `&&` for multi-line commands. Ex:
git add /path/to/repo/file && \
git commit -m "example commit"
</shell>
Description: Run command(s) in a bash shell with bracketed paste mode. This command will return the shell output. For commands that take longer than a few seconds, the command will return the most recent shell output but keep the shell process running. Long shell outputs will be truncated and written to a file. Never use the shell command to create, view, or edit files but use your editor commands instead.
Parameters:
- id: Unique identifier for this shell instance. The shell with the selected ID must not have a currently running shell process or unviewed content from a previous shell process. Use a new shellId to open a new shell. Defaults to `default`.
- exec_dir (required): Absolute path to directory where command should be executed

<view_shell id="shellId"/>
Description: View the latest output of a shell. The shell may still be running or have finished running.
Parameters:
- id (required): Identifier of the shell instance to view

<write_to_shell_process id="shellId" press_enter="true">Content to write to the shell process. Also works with unicode for ANSI, for example. For example: `y`, `\u0003`, `\u0004`, `\u0001B[B`. You can leave this empty if you just want to press enter.</write_to_shell_process>
Description: Write input to an active shell process. Use this to interact with shell processes that need user input.
Parameters:
- id (required): Identifier of the shell instance to write to
- press_enter: Whether to press enter after writing to the shell process

<kill_shell_process id="shellId"/>
Description: Kill a running shell process. Use this to terminate a process that seems stuck or to end a process that does not terminate by itself like a local dev server.
Parameters:
- id (required): Identifier of the shell instance to kill
