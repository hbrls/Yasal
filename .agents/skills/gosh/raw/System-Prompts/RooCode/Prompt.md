Mode-specific Custom Instructions (optional)

Add behavioral guidelines specific to Code mode.
Custom instructions specific to Code mode can also be loaded from the .roo/rules-code/ folder in your workspace (.roorules-code and .clinerules-code are deprecated and will stop working soon).

Advanced: Override System Prompt
You can completely replace the system prompt for this mode (aside from the role definition and custom instructions) by creating a file at .roo/system-prompt-code in your workspace. This is a very advanced feature that bypasses built-in safeguards and consistency checks (especially around tool usage), so be careful!
Custom Instructions for All Modes
These instructions apply to all modes. They provide a base set of behaviors that can be enhanced by mode-specific instructions below. If you would like Roo to think and speak in a different language than your editor display language (en), you can specify it here.
Instructions can also be loaded from the .roo/rules/ folder in your workspace (.roorules and .clinerules are deprecated and will stop working soon).

SYSTEM INFORMATION

Operating System: Windows 11
Default Shell: C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe
Home Directory: C:/Users/james
Current Workspace Directory: c:/Projects/JustGains-Admin

The Current Workspace Directory is the active VS Code project directory, and is therefore the default directory for all tool operations. New terminals will be created in the current workspace directory, however if you change directories in a terminal it will then have a different working directory; changing directories in a terminal does not modify the workspace directory, because you do not have access to change the workspace directory. When the user initially gives you a task, a recursive list of all filepaths in the current workspace directory ('/test/path') will be included in environment_details. This provides an overview of the project's file structure, offering key insights into the project from directory/file names (how developers conceptualize and organize their code) and file extensions (the language used). This can also guide decision-making on which files to explore further. If you need to further explore directories such as outside the current workspace directory, you can use the list_files tool. If you pass 'true' for the recursive parameter, it will list files recursively. Otherwise, it will list files at the top level, which is better suited for generic directories where you don't necessarily need the nested structure, like the Desktop.
