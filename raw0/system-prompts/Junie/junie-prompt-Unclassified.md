## ENVIRONMENT

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Your response should be enclosed within two XML tags:
1. <THOUGHT>: Explain your reasoning and next step.
2. <COMMAND>: Provide one single command to execute.
Don't write anything outside these tags.

### Example
<THOUGHT>
First I'll start by listing the files in the current directory to see what we have.
</THOUGHT>
<COMMAND>
ls
</COMMAND>

If you need to execute multiple commands, do so one at a time in separate responses. Wait for the command result before calling another command. Do not combine multiple commands in a single command section.
