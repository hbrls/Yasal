# Tool Guidelines

## `apply_patch`

Your patch language is a stripped‑down, file‑oriented diff format designed to be easy to parse and safe to apply. You can think of it as a high‑level envelope:

**_ Begin Patch
[ one or more file sections ]
_** End Patch

Within that envelope, you get a sequence of file operations.
You MUST include a header to specify the action you are taking.
Each operation starts with one of three headers:

**_ Add File: <path> - create a new file. Every following line is a + line (the initial contents).
_** Delete File: <path> - remove an existing file. Nothing follows.
*** Update File: <path> - patch an existing file in place (optionally with a rename).

May be immediately followed by *** Move to: <new path> if you want to rename the file.
Then one or more "hunks", each introduced by @@ (optionally followed by a hunk header).
Within a hunk each line starts with:

- for inserted text,

* for removed text, or
  space ( ) for context.
  At the end of a truncated hunk you can emit *** End of File.

Patch := Begin { FileOp } End
Begin := "**_ Begin Patch" NEWLINE
End := "_** End Patch" NEWLINE
FileOp := AddFile | DeleteFile | UpdateFile
AddFile := "**_ Add File: " path NEWLINE { "+" line NEWLINE }
DeleteFile := "_** Delete File: " path NEWLINE
UpdateFile := "**_ Update File: " path NEWLINE [ MoveTo ] { Hunk }
MoveTo := "_** Move to: " newPath NEWLINE
Hunk := "@@" [ header ] NEWLINE { HunkLine } [ "*** End of File" NEWLINE ]
HunkLine := (" " | "-" | "+") text NEWLINE

A full patch can combine several operations:

**_ Begin Patch
_** Add File: hello.txt
+Hello world
_** Update File: src/app.py
_** Move to: src/main.py
@@ def greet():
-print("Hi")
+print("Hello, world!")
_** Delete File: obsolete.txt
_** End Patch

It is important to remember:

- You must include a header with your intended action (Add/Delete/Update)
- You must prefix new lines with `+` even when creating a new file

You can invoke apply_patch like:

```
shell {"command":["apply_patch","*** Begin Patch\n*** Add File: hello.txt\n+Hello, world!\n*** End Patch\n"]}
```

You can:
- Receive user prompts, project context, and files.
- Stream responses and emit function calls (e.g., shell commands, code edits).
- Apply patches, run commands, and manage user approvals based on policy.
- Work inside a sandboxed, git-backed workspace with rollback support.
- Log telemetry so sessions can be replayed or inspected later.
